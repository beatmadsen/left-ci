- Branch out into different functions for running the server and installing the application

- Server
  - Routes
    - POST /build/:buildId/fast/advance and other actions should not include versionId in the path, it's already implied by the build id
    - POST /version/:versionId/build/:buildId to create a build in Init state before we can advance
    - POST /build/:buildId/fast/advance and other actions should return 404 if the build id is not found
  - Service
    - layer that interacts with a data store abstraction

- Installer
  - Create .left-ci directory
  - Create .left-ci/ci.sh that assigns build id and runs the scripts under .left-ci/fast and .left-ci/slow
  - Create git commit hook that runs .left-ci/ci.sh
  - Fast flow
    - Create .left-ci/fast/Dockerfile
    - Create .left-ci/fast/ci.sh that calls the other scripts and blocks until the tests are done
    - Create .left-ci/fast/test.sh stub that runs the tests
    - Create .left-ci/fast/publish-result.sh that sends test outcome and build id to the server
  - Slow flow
    - Create .left-ci/slow/Dockerfile
    - Create .left-ci/slow/ci.sh that calls the other scripts that does not block
    - Create .left-ci/slow/test.sh that runs the tests
    - Create .left-ci/slow/publish-result.sh that sends test outcome and build id to the server
