  - Create git commit hook that runs .left-ci/ci.sh
  - Fast flow
    - Create .left-ci/fast/Dockerfile
    - Create .left-ci/fast/ci.sh that calls the other scripts and blocks until the tests are done
    - Create .left-ci/fast/test.sh stub that runs the tests
    - Create .left-ci/fast/publish-result.sh that sends test outcome and build id to the server
  - Slow flow
    - Create .left-ci/slow/Dockerfile
    - Create .left-ci/slow/ci.sh that calls the other scripts that does not block
    - Create .left-ci/slow/test.sh that runs the tests
